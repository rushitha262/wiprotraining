What is jQuery?

Jquery is a fast , small, advanced or feature-rich javascript library that gives you
to simplify document manipulation , event handling , animations and Ajax interaction

before working with these frameworks like React  , Angular.
JQuery allows developers to write less code instead of developers used to require a lot of repeated code in java script

Key features :
1) DOM Manipulation : Easy to select and modify
2) Event Handling : simplify and helps in managing events like click , hover , mouse ,keyboard events 
3) Animations & effects 
4) Ajax :-  fetch and send data without refreshing the entire page
5) Cross- Browser compatibility  -- On all browsers it works perfectly


Why use jquery?
less code
browser compatibility
fast 
very powerful plugins ---- toggle ,  sliders  , modals , tables
Event handling , animations

$(document).ready() ---  wait until HTML is loaded
$(#btn).click() --- It selects the button by it id, attaches a click event handler
$(#text).text("button" )  -- to change the text

use cases :

1. Form validation
2. image slider or carousels
3. Dynamic html updates without reloading your page
4. show/hide
5. toggle
6. fetching data from APIs (.get .post.)


AJAX --  Asynchronous javascript and XML
It is not a programming languages -- it's just a technique for fetching data from the server without reloading the whole page

Why we use AJAx:
to update part of a webpage without refreshing the whole page
to send data to the server in the background
to make or desgin websites faster and more interactive
commonly used with APIs for dynamic content

In web development:when a webpage needs new data :
then without ajax : reload the whole page
with Ajax : request just the required data and update HTML dynamically . which improves efficiency and perfomance
